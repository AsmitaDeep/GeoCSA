# GeoCSA
A GEE-based app which gives time series plots of Sentinel - 2 based vegetation indices i.e. NDVI, NDWI, EVI and SAVI for the user-defined region of interest (ROI). The app is in the development stage and is aimed at making it a one-stop-solution for monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of ground-based interventions under Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA).
